Hypercard stack
===============

An engine for creating [Myst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myst)-like [hypercard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperCard) games. This old-fashioned stype of point and click game is essentially a collection of prerendered slides with links to other slides, making the game's map navigable. These slides can contain dynamic and interactive content, such as doors that can be opened and closed.

This project is Java SE 6 compliant to maximize support across various platforms.

##Planned features

* Level Editor
* Support for user-created level packs
* Scripting of custom puzzles
* Support for multiple rendering engines, which may be changed during runtime (maybe)
  * OpenGL rendering
  * AWT rendering
* Support for platforms which handle I/O and persistence differently
* Tentative Android support?
