	B-tree?
	Zip file
		directory structure for resources
			metadata file describing level as well as where resources are located in the zip file
			folder: "Locations"
				folder per location, named with the locations unique identifier
					metadata for that specific location
					contains location specific resources (views/animations/sounds)
			folder: "Global"
				contains resources used globally (sounds, etc)
